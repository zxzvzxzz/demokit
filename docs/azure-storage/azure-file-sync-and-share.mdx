## Demo Request
**Fill out this [survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR2TLimZclS5AtMUGZWZi-PZUMTcxWElaU0xSSzkxNDk2SkhQQVNVMDlLTC4u) in order to use the demo.** Waiting for a completion e-mail sent from ythuang@microsoft.com, demo access credential will be provided in that e-mail, you are good to go with below demo scenarios now.

## Demo Environment
Use the credential provided in e-mail to logon [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), click "Resource Groups" from left panel, 3 resources groups will be listed in below
<img alt="azure-file-1" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-1.png')}/>

- "FILESYNC", has "Azure File Sync" resources
- "HOWDY", has all on-premises resources for a faked company called "Howdy", including 2 VMs DC and workstation. DC is also a file server which has a shared folder called "Share" located in F:\Share.
- "HOWDYONAZURE", has Azure resources including Azure stroage account, file share and privatelink of file share

Click each resource group and show it to your customer how it looks like

## Azure File On-premises AD DS Authentication
1. Azure Filesâ€¯supports identity-based authentication over Server Message Block (SMB), for more information about AD DS authentication over SMB, refer to this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-active-directory-enable). This demo scenario will include on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) authentication.

2. Click this [URL](https://portal.azure.com/#@howdy.site/resource/subscriptions/4ee28f16-3d14-4ee0-8d50-f4b8afc5723c/resourceGroups/HOWDYONAZURE/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/howdyfiles/configuration), will bring you to storage account howdyfiles' configuration page, the storage account has already enabled AD DS authentication. 
<img alt="azure-file-6" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-6.png')}/>

3. The storage account has a file share called `share` created already, normally to access this share `\\howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net\share`, we need to use storage account "Access key", but with AD DS authentication enabled, you can use your domain user account to access it.
<img alt="azure-file-7" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-7.png')}/>

4. Run `mstsc /v:workstation.corp.howdy.site` from a Windows workstation, use credential provided in e-mail to logon, now you will be logged on as a domain user.

5. From logged on terminal session, run "\\howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net\share", a shared folder will open.
<img alt="azure-file-8" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-8.png')}/>

6. Try create, modify and delete any files or folders, the experience is similar just like using an on-premises file server.

## Azure File Share Private Endpoint
1. Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. The service will be only available and accessible from your private network address space, if ExpressRouter/VPN connection is established between your on-premises network and Azure virtual network, you can access private endpoint from on-premises as well. In this demo, we will use Azure file share private endpoint as an example to show how it works.

2. Logon to on-premises workstation. Skip this step if you already logged on workstation. Run `mstsc /v:workstation.corp.howdy.site` from a Windows workstation, use credential provided in e-mail to logon.

3. From the terminal session, open a command prompt window, run `nslookup -opt d2 howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net`, the result will look like in below
```sh {11-13,15-17}
...
Got answer (103 bytes):
    HEADER:
        opcode = QUERY, id = 6, rcode = NOERROR
        header flags:  response, want recursion, recursion avail.
        questions = 1,  answers = 2,  authority records = 0,  additional = 0

    QUESTIONS:
        howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net, type = A, class = IN
    ANSWERS:
    ->  howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net
        type = CNAME, class = IN, dlen = 25
        canonical name = howdyfiles.privatelink.file.core.windows.net
        ttl = 53 (53 secs)
    ->  howdyfiles.privatelink.file.core.windows.net
        type = A, class = IN, dlen = 4
        internet address = 10.1.1.4
        ttl = 3600 (1 hour)
...
```

4. You will see `howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net` is actually a CNAME to `howdyfiles.privatelink.file.core.windows.net`, and `howdyfiles.privatelink.file.core.windows.net` is resolved to a private IP address `10.1.1.4`, this is because we have enabled private endpoint for Azure file share. Open this [URL](https://portal.azure.com/#@howdy.site/resource/subscriptions/4ee28f16-3d14-4ee0-8d50-f4b8afc5723c/resourceGroups/HOWDYONAZURE/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/howdyfilespe/overview), the page will list how private endpoint is configured
<img alt="azure-file-9" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-9.png')}/>

5. When private endpoint is enabled, Azure storage firewall will deny access to traffic from all networks (including internet traffic) on the public endpoint. Open this [URL](https://portal.azure.com/#@howdy.site/resource/subscriptions/4ee28f16-3d14-4ee0-8d50-f4b8afc5723c/resourceGroups/HOWDYONAZURE/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/howdyfiles/accessControl) to show how storage firewall settings look like

## Azure File Sync
1. "Azure File Sync" is used to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files. For more informaiton about "Azure File Sync", refer to this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide?tabs=azure-portal).We have pre-installed "Azure Storage Sync Agent" on on-premises file server (DC) and configured "Sync group" from "Storage Sync Service". To show how it looks like, click this [URL](https://portal.azure.com/#@howdy.site/resource/subscriptions/4ee28f16-3d14-4ee0-8d50-f4b8afc5723c/resourceGroups/FILESYNC/providers/Microsoft.StorageSync/storageSyncServices/filesync/overview)
<img alt="azure-file-2" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-2.png')}/>

2. Click "Howdy" under "Sync groups" will bring you to detailed configration page, currently it has "1 cloud endpoints" and "1 server endpoints" configured
<img alt="azure-file-3" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-3.png')}/>

3. Click each endpoint in above page will show how "Cloud Endpoint" and "Server Endpoint" configuration look like.
<img alt="azure-file-4" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-4.png')}/>
<img alt="azure-file-5" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-5.png')}/>

4. Logon to on-premises workstation. Skip this step if you already logged on workstation. Run `mstsc /v:workstation.corp.howdy.site` from a Windows workstation, use credential provided in e-mail to logon.

5. Visit `\\dc\share` from windows explore, this will open shared folder from our local file server. Try to create a test file say test.txt and add one line "This is a test file" to it. Now open another explore window and visit `\\howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net\share`, it will has test.txt as well(It may take some time, if you didn't see this file, press F5 to refresh for a few of times). This is because "Azure storage sync agent" help us sync the file to azure storage files.
<img alt="azure-file-11" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-storage/azure-file-11.png')}/>

6. Azure file sync will also handle conflict, it will generate a conflict file, if the file was changed in multiple places at the same time (or more accurately, if one change was before having received the other change). For example:
    - File test.txt is modified in location X, and given LastWriteTime of 1:00
    - File test.txt is modified in location Y, and given LastWriteTime of 1:05
    - When conflict resolution happens, the file content from 1:05 will be get to keep the filename test.txt
    - The file content from 1:00 will become a 'conflict file', and given the name test-\<MachineName\>.txt
    - The \<MachineName\> is the name of the server which produced the change from 1:00
    - If the change came from a direct write to the cloud share, it will be given the name \<MachineName\> will be "Cloud"

7. To explain how azure file sync handles conflict, open test.txt from `\\dc\share` and `\\howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net` seperately, append a line "local" to test.txt opened from `\\dc\share`, then press Ctrl+S to save the change, append a line "cloud" to test.txt opened from `\\howdyfiles.file.core.windows.net`, then press Ctrl+S to save the change.
