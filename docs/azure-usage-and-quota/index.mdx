## Demo Scenarios
## Hints first

as a customer, once I want to get the ratio of Usage to Quota, on the Azure portal， I can access every Subscription page to capture the basic info one by one, but this is not very convenient and friendly  to get the centralized report for  analysis , so I hope a unified way to get the ratio of usage and quota report for making the usage management and quota plan more.
- it is an "Usage and Quota" shows in Azure portal, on the Azure portal , have to check it one by one  .
<img alt="portal-1" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-usage-and-quota/UsageAndQuotaOnPortal.png')}/>

## what I want looks like
- A file record all subscriptions quota and usage staus , user can show it and do usage analysis for resource optimization，like following 
<img alt="report-1" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-usage-and-quota/UsageQuotaReportCsv1.png')}/>
- can be analyzed with power BI 
<img alt="report-2" src={useBaseUrl('img/azure-usage-and-quota/UsageQuotaReportDesignPivot.png')}/>


## how to implement it
