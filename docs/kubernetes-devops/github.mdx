## Github Actions Demo Scenarios
Github devops demo leverages github actions to build application, generate docker image, push image to azure container registry, and deploy image to AKS. This demo supports below scenarios
- Github actions pipeline – build & deploy
- Canary deployment on AKS
- Roll back on error to previous successful deployment

To use this demo, follow "Demo Steps" in below section

## Demo Steps
### Github Actions Pipeline
1. Open URL https://github.com/devopsonazure/vote-github/blob/master/azure-vote/config_file.cfg, click edit icon and change TITLE from `Azure Voting App - Github Actions(v1)` to ` Azure Voting App - Github Actions(v2)`.
```txt {2}
# UI Configurations
TITLE = 'Azure Voting App - Github Actions(v1)'
VOTE1VALUE = 'Cats'
VOTE2VALUE = 'Dogs'
SHOWHOST = 'false'
```
2. Click `Commit changes` button to commit the change.
<img alt="github-2" src={useBaseUrl('img/kubernetes-devops/github-2.png')}/>
3. Open URL https://github.com/devopsonazure/vote-github/actions, refresh the page (might be multiple times), it should display github actions pipeline is started eventually. Two actions should be running, one is code scanning, another is build and deploy. 
<img alt="github-3" src={useBaseUrl('img/kubernetes-devops/github-3.png')}/>
4. Click `Build and deploy` action, it has two stages, one is build and another is deploy, explain to your customer what activities github action is doing right now, basically, `Build and deploy` action will build code, push image to azure container registry, and deploy image to AKS.

5. Once build & deploy is completed, open URL http://vote-github.k8s.devsecops.ink/, application's version should be changed to `Azure Voting App – Github Actions(v2)`
<img alt="github-5" src={useBaseUrl('img/kubernetes-devops/github-5.png')}/>

### Canary Deployment on AKS
1. Open URL https://github.com/devopsonazure/vote-github/edit/master/.github/workflows/build-deploy.yaml, uncomment highlighted lines in below then commit the change to github.
```yaml {14-15}
    - name: "Deploy azure vote front"
      uses: Azure/k8s-deploy@v1
      timeout-minutes: 5
      with:
        namespace: ${{env.NAMESPACE}}
        manifests: |
          manifests/front.yml
          manifests/service.yml
          manifests/ingress.yml
        images: |
          ${{secrets.REGISTRY_URL}}/${{env.IMAGE_NAME}}:${{ github.sha }}
        imagepullsecrets: |
          acr-secret
        #strategy: canary
        #percentage: 100
```
2. Open URL https://github.com/devopsonazure/vote-github/blob/master/azure-vote/config_file.cfg, modify highlighted line to `'Azure Voting App - Github Actions(v3)'`, then commit change。
```txt {2}
# UI Configurations
TITLE = 'Azure Voting App - Github Actions(v1)'
VOTE1VALUE = 'Cats'
VOTE2VALUE = 'Dogs'
SHOWHOST = 'false'
```
3. Open URL http://vote-github.k8s.devsecops.ink/, application's version should be changed to v3.
<img alt="github-8" src={useBaseUrl('img/kubernetes-devops/github-8.png')}/>
4. Now, open a new browser and use in-private mode, go to URL http://vote-github.k8s.devsecops.ink/, you will find application's version remains at v2.
<img alt="github-9" src={useBaseUrl('img/kubernetes-devops/github-9.png')}/>
5. This is because we have enabled canary deployment, version v2 and v3 are both exist in same cluster, AKS will handle the requests and distribute them to different version of services.  From AKS backend, it has two deploys, refer to highlighted lines in below
```sh {4,6}
kubectl get deploy -n github 
NAME                        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
azure-vote-back             1/1     1            1           3d23h
azure-vote-front            1/1     1            1           3d19h
azure-vote-front-baseline   1/1     1            1           22m
azure-vote-front-canary     1/1     1            1           22m
```
### Rollback on Error
1. Open URL https://github.com/devopsonazure/vote-github/edit/master/.github/workflows/build-deploy.yaml, append "_failed" into below highlighted line, change it to `${{secrets.REGISTRY_URL}}/${{env.IMAGE_NAME}}:${{ github.sha }}_failed`, then commit change to github, it will trigger a failed deployment
```yaml {11}
    - name: "Deploy azure vote front"
      uses: Azure/k8s-deploy@v1
      timeout-minutes: 5
      with:
        namespace: ${{env.NAMESPACE}}
        manifests: |
          manifests/front.yml
          manifests/service.yml
          manifests/ingress.yml
        images: |
          ${{secrets.REGISTRY_URL}}/${{env.IMAGE_NAME}}:${{ github.sha }}
        imagepullsecrets: |
          acr-secret
        #strategy: canary
        #percentage: 100
```
2. Open URL https://github.com/devopsonazure/vote-github/actions, click the newest `Build and deploy` pipeline, wait for a while until the deployment get failed, show below screen to your customer, github actions pipeline will roll back on error to previous successful deployment.
<img alt="github-11" src={useBaseUrl('img/kubernetes-devops/github-11.png')}/>
3. Open URL http://vote-github.k8s.devsecops.ink/, the application is still running, it proves the service is not affected by failed deployment.
