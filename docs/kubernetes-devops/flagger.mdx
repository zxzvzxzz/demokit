## Flagger Demo Scenarios
Flagger is a progressive delivery tool that automates the release process for applications running on Kubernetes. Flagger implements several deployment strategies (Canary releases, A/B testing, Blue/Green mirroring) using a service mesh (App Mesh, Istio, Linkerd) or an ingress controller (Contour, Gloo, NGINX) for traffic routing.
